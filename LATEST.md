- Fixed for v40.0
- Reworked the way Ascended Upgrades internally stack, which means:
    - No more lag from purchasing upgrades / selecting towers
    - Upgrade effects now stack **additively** instead of multiplicatively by default
        - I made this change because otherwise the power scaling far outpaces the cost and can trivialize freeplay
        - The old behavior can be restored by enabling the "Op Multiplicative Scaling" mod option
        - Changed the default Upgrade Cost Increase setting from $1000 to $500 now that it scales less
- Upgrades now have additional effects for the non damaging effects of towers
    - Ascended Strength also increases the value of cash generation effects and improves damage buffs given by the tower
    - Ascended Speed also increases production speed (bananas/crates per turn) and improves attack speed buffs given by the tower
    - Ascended Force also increases capacity of banks/traps and improves range/pierce buffs given by the tower
