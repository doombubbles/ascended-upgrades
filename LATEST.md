- Internal rework for the upgrade checking to be more compatible with other mods that affect upgrading like Paths++ and Ultimate Crosspathing with <15 upgrades allowed
  - As a byproduct, Tier 4 towers can receive Ascended Upgrades if you have the Tier 5 for their highest path already
  - This also involved removing the Shared Tower Scaling setting, but I don't think anyone was actually using that lol
- Ascended Upgrades now work with [Useful Utilities](https://github.com/doombubbles/useful-utilities#readme)' Copy/Paste Towers,
  though for the Tier 5s you will need [Unlimited 5th Tiers+](https://github.com/doombubbles/unlimited-5th-tiers#readme)
